# ABSTRACT: Author tests making sure correct line endings are used
# SEEALSO: Test::EOL, Dist::Zilla::Plugin::EOLTests

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generate an author L<Test::EOL>.

This is an extension of L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles>, providing
the following files:

=for :list
* xt/author/eol.t
a standard Test::EOL test

=attr trailing_whitespace

If this option is set to a true value,
C<< { trailing_whitespace => 1 } >> will be passed to
L<Test::EOL/all_perl_files_ok>. It defaults to C<1>.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This module is a fork of L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::EOLTests> and was originally
written by Florian Ragwitz. It was forked because author the Test:: namespace
is preferred and because I would prefer to have EOL tests be Author tests.
